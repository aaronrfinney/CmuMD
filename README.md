# This is the CmuMD repository

This repository hosts the implementation for PLUMED 2 of the C$\mu$MD method, which allows to mimic open boundary conditions in NVT molecular simulations involving solid/fluid interfaces, and enables the simulation of concentration-driven fluxes through porous membranes. 

The method, with an application to crystal growth problems is described in the paper: 

__Molecular dynamics simulations of solutions at constant chemical potential__ 
C Perego, M Salvalaglio, M Parrinello, [J Chem Phys (14), 144113, 2015](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=1191), [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07825)

The adaptation of C$\mu$MD to model concentration driven membrane fluxes is described in the paper: 

__Concentration gradient driven molecular dynamics: a new method for simulations of membrane permeation and separation__
A Ozcan, C Perego, M Salvalaglio, M Parrinello, O Yazaydin
Chem Sci 8 (5), 3858-3865

The version hosted here has been developed by [Dr. Claudio Perego](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TwqxhpUAAAAJ) and is maintained by the [Salvalaglio](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/molecular-modelling) and [Yazaydin](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucecoya/) groups at [UCL Chemical Engineering](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemical-engineering/). 

The method has been further developed into a "cannibalistic" variant, and to model crystal nucleation at constant supersaturation by [Dr. Tarak Karmakar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=LWBFC34AAAAJ).
